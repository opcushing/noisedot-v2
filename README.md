Noisedot is a web app where users post and discover cool sound samples from around their local community. We [originally built NoiseDot](https://www.github.com/jamieRollison/noisedot) in framework-less HTML and JS with Firebase for CS 196: Intro to CS Honors at UIUC, and now we're rebuilding it from the ground up using SvelteKit, MongoDB, Amazon S3, and Tailwind CSS.
